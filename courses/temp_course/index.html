  <h1>Predicting DCI</h1>
  <div class="course_description">
    To develop and validate a prediction model for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using random featurization of physiologic time series data, demonstrating improved precision over standard methods.Materials and Methods - 488 consecutive SAH admissions from 2006-2014 to a tertiary care hospital were included. Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and grading scales were evaluated age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach, Random Kitchen Sink (RKS), extracted features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset mFS, baseline information including grading scales, physiologic features, and combined baseline and physiologic features with redundant feature reduction. Models were applied to the validation dataset.
